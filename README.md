# Terraform Labs

This repository contains examples and labs for setting up infrastructure using Terraform. The labs cover various scenarios and configurations for both local development environments with Docker and cloud deployments on AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker (for running local containers)
- AWS CLI (optional, for AWS access)

If you intend to set up infrastructure both locally with Docker and on AWS, you'll need both Docker and the AWS CLI installed. If you only plan to work with local Docker containers, you can skip installing the AWS CLI.

## Labs

The labs are organized into separate directories, each covering a specific use case or scenario. You can explore each lab individually to understand how to use Terraform for provisioning infrastructure.

Feel free to explore the labs and modify the configurations according to your requirements. Happy Terraforming!
